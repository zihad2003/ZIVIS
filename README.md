# 🌌 Neon Air Draw — AI Spatial Interface

A high-performance, real-time AI air drawing web application that utilizes advanced hand tracking for a "Minority Report" style spatial interface. 

Draw in the air with your dominant hand and manipulate your creations in real-time with your non-dominant hand using intuitive gestures (Move, Scale, Rotate).

## ✨ Key Features

*   **✋ Dual-Hand Interaction**: 
    *   **Right Hand (Dominant)**: Handles high-precision drawing, selective erasing, and canvas clearing.
    *   **Left Hand (Secondary)**: Dedicated to spatial transformations (Move, Scale, Rotate) of existing strokes.
*   **📐 Non-Destructive Transforms**: Strokes retain their original coordinate data. All manipulations (TX, TY, Scale, Rotation) are applied at render time via matrix-based math.
*   **🕶️ Minimalist Glassmorphism UI**: A premium, aesthetic interface with real-time HUD and visual feedback guides.
*   **⚡ High Performance**: Native WebGL-based rendering engine optimized for 60FPS fluid interactions.
*   **🌀 Physics-Based Interaction**: Smooth inertia on stroke movement and snap-to-angle (45°) for rotation.
*   **📖 Gesture Guide**: Built-in interactive manual explaining every movement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React + Vite
*   **Hand Tracking**: @mediapipe/hands
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion
*   **Icons**: Lucide React (with custom inline SVG fallbacks for brand icons)
*   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Modern Glassmorphism & Neon Aesthetics)
